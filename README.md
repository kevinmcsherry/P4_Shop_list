# Project 4 Django - Shopping List

The shopping list product is a website which allows users to login to an application, view thier shopping lists, add items, edit items and remove items as appropriate.
The application is fully responsive and mobile friendly, so that it can easily be used on the move, while you are in the shop.  All data is realtime, so updates are immediate to help the user experience, by allowing users to know exactly what they need to purchase, and also know what has been purchased.
The user can add a description to the items incase they want a particular brand of item for exmaple, this is also fully viewable via mobile devices.
The shopping list application was designed and planned using agile methodoligies - so broken down into tangeable pieces of work, placed into iterations and worked through systematically until desired outcome achieved. 
During deisgn, planning and devlopment, due care was taken to put the user first in relation to thier needs and also user experience in terms of ease of use along with enjoyment.  The enjoyment and ease of use is through easy navigation and clear utilities.
The shopping list application was througughly tested, as will be documented and made available in this document. 
Security is also in mind when devloping this application, aloowing only looged in users to access the site and to also only allow users to see thier own data.
I think you will agree, that this application is a very useful and easy to use tool to help many shoppers!
